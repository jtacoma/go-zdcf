## Known Issues

* gozmq, while excellent, doesn't yet support setting options on a context.
* when combining configuration sources, any socket options in later sources will completely replace options in previous sources.
* multi-valued settings (bind, connect, subscribe) in JSON will only accept arrays.
* configuration validation is mostly absent.
